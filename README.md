# VRunner
An endless runner with VVVVVV mechanics, made with [Godot](http://www.godotengine.org/)

**[Play the game here](https://jacic.itch.io/vrunner)**

This is basically my first Godot project, so I wanted to make something simple and quick to learn the Godot way of doing things. I'm making it open source so others can learn from it if they wish. I don't claim that any of this is "correct" or the best way to do things, though, because as I said, I'm new to Godot.

I started with the code from [this project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pC8n4s-_I), thinking that it would help me jumpstart the project and get a basic platformer, but I ended up using almost nothing from it because the design of these games immediately diverged. :p

Enjoy!
